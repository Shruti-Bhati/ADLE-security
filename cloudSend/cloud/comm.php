ADLE is a cloud based file upload service.
Cloud based "File System" is different from the file system available at standalone computer.
As cloud providers replicate data on geographically distributed clouds.So once the user or owner of file launches 
requests to delete a file , it must ideally get deleted from all the clouds.
The onus of this task lies at the cloud provider.The user may not be aware of that fact that data is present at some clouds
which may be used by some malicious insiders at some time in future.<br />
That is the reason which is the bottleneck for the acceptance/popularity of cloud because the problem 
of incomplete data deletion
